    <h2><strong>Chocolate and coffee</strong> and other things I crave</h2>

      This is a paragraph of text. Let`s pretend it`s part of a long article,
      where we expect many people to quickly scan through it, and
      <b>we want to mark certain phrases with some boldness</b>, some visual
      attention, so that those sentences jump out and people don`t miss them.
      Almost like having a pull-quote.
